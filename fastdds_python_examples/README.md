# Fast DDS Python binding examples

## Prerequisites

`fastdds_python_examples` has the following dependencies:

* `fastcdr`: Fast CDR library.
* `fasrtps`: Fast DDS library.
* `fastdds_python`: Fast DDS Python binding.

## Compile and install

The examples can be built either using [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/index.html) or CMake.
Remember to source the installation environment afterwards before launching the Python script so the required Python modules are found.
